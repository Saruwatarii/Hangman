# Hangman
Hangman is a popular yet grim intellectual game. A cruel computer hides a word from you. Letter by letter you try to guess it. If you fail, you'll be hanged, if you win, you'll survive. The gameplay should look like:

1. In the main menu, a player can choose to either play or exit the game;

2. If the user chooses to play, the computer picks a word from a list: this will be the riddle;

3. The computer asks the player to enter a letter that (s)he thinks is in the word;

4. If there's no such letter in the word and this letter hasn't been tried before, the computer counts it as a miss. A player can afford only up to 8 misses before the game is over;

5. If the letter does occur in the word, the computer notifies the player. If there are letters left to guess, the computer invites the player to go on.

6. When the entire word is uncovered, it's a victory! The game calculates the final score and goes back to the main menu.
